During the tutorial session, we will go through the practical exercise step-by-step and solve any issues you may have encountered. 0.4 What do I need for this module? For this module, you will need some basic computer experience, the ability to troubleshoot on your own, a computer program, and a data file. 1. Basic computer experience. You need to know how to download, save, change file formats, install programs, and operate your own computer. This can be Windows, Mac, or Linux, or anything. But this course does not provide basic computer support. 2. The ability to troubleshoot independently. You will often encounter issues, unexpected problems, and many questions. As they relate to the content of the course, I am here to help. However, one goal of this course is to teach you how to solve problems on your own. So this course will require a level of independent problem solving ability. For example, a quick Google search can answer almost any questions. 3. R (and R-studio). Please download this and install it on your computer. 4. A data file. We will use one dataset for the whole term.
