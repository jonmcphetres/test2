# Overview {-}

Welcome to Applied Statistics in Psychology at Durham University.

Module Leader:Dr. Jonathon McPhetres

Email:jonathon.mcphetres@durham.ac.uk

Office hours: TBD


## What is this web page?

This is our "textbook" for the course. This page will document all of the code, examples, and activities we use during the lectures and during the tutorial sessions. It is designed to be a simple reference point and codebook. Every activity and exercise will be documented here.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of this term, you will:

* Be familiar with R-based computing and data management
* Be able to conduct and report basic statistical analyses
* Be able to create a reproducible report in APA style using R-markdown

## Course Structure

Each week will follow the same struture. There will be a brief pre-lecture assignment that you will bring to the lecture. The lecture will cover theory and a demonstration of the relevant techniques and assign a practical exercise for you to complete on your own time. During the tutorial, we will go over the practical exercise step-by-step.

**1. Pre-lecture assignment**
Prior to the lecture, you will be asked to complete a small (~5 min) assignment. Please bring the results to class. This exercise is important in identifying what you do and don't know so that you have reference point when evaluating what you've learned throughout this course.

**2. Lecture**
The lecture takes place on **Monday at 11-1** each week in the computer lab. During the lecture, we will discuss theoretical and practical considerations for a given procedure. We will also go over a demonstration of that procedure and the practical exercise will be assigned.

**3. Practical Exercise**
This is a hands-on activity to apply the skills you learned during the lecture. This will be assigned at the end of each lecture and should be completed prior to the tutorial session. Please set aside a couple hours each week to work on the practical exercise. They should get easier as you go along, but they will take time.

**4. Tutorial Session**
The tutorial session takes place on **Friday from 1-3pm** in the computer lab. During the tutorial session, we will go through the practical exercise step-by-step and solve any issues you may have encountered.


## What do I need for this module?

For this module, you will need some basic computer experience, a computer program, and one data file. 

**1. Basic computer experience.** 

You need to know how to download and save files, change file formats, install programs, and generally operate your own computer. This can be on Windows, Mac, or Linux, or any system you are familiar with. But this course does not provide basic computer support. 

Similarly, there will often be questions or issues that you encounter and, like anything, this course will require a level of independent problem solving ability. You are encouraged to consult outside sources such as Stackoverflow, StatsExchange, and Google in order to problem solve and expand your programming and analysis capabilities.

**2. R (and R-studio).** 
You will need both R and RStudio.
Please download these and install them on your computer.
R:
RStudio: 

**3. A data file.** 
We will use one dataset for the whole term. It is available on the DUO page for this course or you can downlaod it here:
